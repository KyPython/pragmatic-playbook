# Project 9: Deployment Strategies

## The Problem

You manually deploy by SSHing into servers. No CI/CD, no monitoring, no runbooks. When something breaks, you don't know until users complain.

## Why It Matters

**Production-grade deployment** means:
- **CI/CD pipeline** - Automated testing and deployment
- **Monitoring** - Know immediately when something breaks
- **Runbooks** - Clear procedures for common issues
- **Deploy on Friday 5 PM** - Without fear

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you'll learn to:
1. Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD
2. Implement monitoring with Sentry
3. Create deployment runbooks
4. Automate testing and deployment

## Expected Outcomes

After implementing deployment strategies, you'll have:
- ✅ Automated CI/CD pipeline
- ✅ Error monitoring and alerting
- ✅ Deployment runbooks
- ✅ Deploy with confidence
