# Project 8: Advanced Patterns

## The Problem

Your modules are tightly coupled with circular dependencies. Adding a new feature requires changing 5 different files. Future features take 3x longer because everything is interconnected.

## Why It Matters

**Orthogonal design** means systems are independent. Changes to one module don't affect others. This enables:
- **3x faster feature development** - Work on modules independently
- **Easier testing** - Test modules in isolation
- **Better maintainability** - Understand one module without understanding all
- **Reduced bugs** - Changes don't cascade through the system

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you'll learn to:
1. Design orthogonal systems
2. Eliminate circular dependencies
3. Create clear module boundaries
4. Build systems that are easy to extend

## The Starter Code

The `starter/` folder contains tightly coupled modules with circular dependencies.

## Your Mission

1. **Identify coupling** between modules
2. **Eliminate circular dependencies**
3. **Create clear boundaries**
4. **Refactor to orthogonal design**

## Expected Outcomes

After refactoring, you'll have:
- ✅ Independent modules
- ✅ No circular dependencies
- ✅ Clear boundaries
- ✅ 3x faster feature development
