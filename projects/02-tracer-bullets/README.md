# Project 2: Tracer Bullets

## The Problem

You need to build a property listings API, but you're stuck in "analysis paralysis." You're trying to build the perfect system with all features, but you can't ship anything. The incomplete code sits in your repo, never deployed, never tested with real users.

## Why It Matters

**Tracer bullets** are bullets that light up as they fly, showing you exactly where they're going. In software, tracer bullets are end-to-end features that work from day one, even if incomplete. They let you:

- **See the full path** from user to database
- **Test with real users** immediately
- **Iterate based on feedback** instead of assumptions
- **Deploy incomplete but working** systems

**Real Impact:**
- Launch in 2 weeks instead of 3 months
- Get user feedback before building wrong features
- Build confidence through working code
- Reduce risk by shipping early

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you'll learn to:
1. Build end-to-end features quickly
2. Prioritize features that deliver value
3. Deploy incomplete but working systems
4. Iterate based on real user feedback

## The Starter Code

The `starter/` folder contains an incomplete Next.js app:
- Basic structure exists
- API endpoints are stubbed (return empty data)
- UI is incomplete (missing forms, no error handling)
- No deployment configuration
- Missing critical features

## Your Mission

1. **Complete the API endpoints** - Full CRUD for listings
2. **Build the UI** - Forms, error handling, loading states
3. **Add deployment config** - Make it deployable
4. **Test end-to-end** - Verify the full flow works

## Expected Outcomes

After completing this project, you'll have:
- ✅ Working API with full CRUD
- ✅ Complete UI with forms and error handling
- ✅ Deployable application
- ✅ End-to-end feature that works

## Getting Started

```bash
# Navigate to this project
cd projects/02-tracer-bullets

# Install dependencies
cd starter && npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# After completing, compare with solution
cd ../solution && npm install && npm run dev
```

## Time Impact

**Before:**
- Planning: 2 weeks
- Building: 8 weeks
- Testing: 2 weeks
- **Total: 3 months**

**After (Tracer Bullets):**
- End-to-end MVP: 2 weeks
- Iterate based on feedback: Ongoing
- **Total: 2 weeks to launch**

**ROI:** Launch 10x faster, get feedback 10x earlier

## Next Steps

After completing this project:
1. Deploy your MVP to production
2. Get real user feedback
3. Iterate based on what users actually need
4. Move to Project 3: DRY Refactor
