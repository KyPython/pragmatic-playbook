# Project 10: Architecture Audit

## The Problem

Your codebase has grown organically. You know there are issues, but you don't know where to start. Technical debt is invisible until it's expensive.

## Why It Matters

**Architecture audit** gives you:
- **Clear picture** of your codebase health
- **Prioritized improvement plan** - Fix highest ROI items first
- **90-day action plan** - Measurable improvements
- **3.2x ROI** - Every dollar invested returns $3.20

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you'll learn to:
1. Audit existing codebases
2. Identify improvement opportunities
3. Create actionable 90-day plans
4. Measure ROI of improvements

## Expected Outcomes

After completing the audit, you'll have:
- ✅ Complete codebase analysis
- ✅ Prioritized improvement roadmap
- ✅ 90-day action plan
- ✅ ROI calculations
