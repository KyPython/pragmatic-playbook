# Tracer Bullets: Launch in 2 Weeks Instead of 3 Months

I spent 3 months building the "perfect" feature. Users hated it. I should have shipped in 2 weeks and iterated.

## What Are Tracer Bullets?

Tracer bullets light up as they fly, showing you exactly where they're going. In software, tracer bullets are end-to-end features that work from day one, even if incomplete.

## The Problem

Most teams fall into "analysis paralysis":
- Planning: 2 weeks
- Building: 8 weeks
- Testing: 2 weeks
- **Total: 3 months**

By the time you ship, you've built the wrong thing.

## The Solution

Build end-to-end features that work immediately:
- **Week 1:** End-to-end flow (UI → API → Database)
- **Week 2:** Polish and deploy
- **Week 3+:** Iterate based on real user feedback

## Real Example

I built a property listings feature:
- **Old way:** 3 months planning, building, testing → Users didn't use it
- **Tracer bullet way:** 2 weeks end-to-end → Users loved it, requested changes → Iterated in 1 week

**Result:** Shipped in 2 weeks, iterated based on feedback, launched in 6 weeks total.

## How to Build Tracer Bullets

1. **Start with the full path** - UI → API → Database (even if simple)
2. **Make it work end-to-end** - Don't optimize yet
3. **Deploy to production** - Get real user feedback
4. **Iterate quickly** - Change based on what users actually do

## The Mindset Shift

Stop asking "Is it perfect?" Start asking "Does it work end-to-end?"

Perfect is the enemy of shipped. Tracer bullets get you to shipped in 2 weeks, then you iterate to perfect based on real data.

**Launch in 2 weeks. Iterate forever.**
