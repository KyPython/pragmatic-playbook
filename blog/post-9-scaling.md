# Scaling Your Team: 3x Faster Features Through Clean Architecture

Our team grew from 2 to 8 developers. Feature development slowed from 2 weeks to 6 weeks. Then we refactored to clean architecture and features are 3x faster again.

## The Problem

Tightly coupled code:
- Adding a feature requires changing 5 files
- New developers take 2 weeks to onboard
- Bugs cascade through the system
- Features take 6 weeks instead of 2

## The Solution

Clean architecture:
- Independent modules
- Clear boundaries
- Easy to test
- Easy to extend

## Real Impact

**Before:**
- Feature development: 6 weeks
- Onboarding: 2 weeks
- Bug rate: High (cascading)
- Team velocity: Slow

**After:**
- Feature development: 2 weeks
- Onboarding: 3 days
- Bug rate: Low (isolated)
- Team velocity: Fast

## Implementation

1. **Identify coupling** - Find tightly coupled modules
2. **Create boundaries** - Define clear interfaces
3. **Eliminate circular dependencies** - Break cycles
4. **Refactor incrementally** - One module at a time

## The ROI

**3x faster features** - Independent modules
**4x faster onboarding** - Clear architecture
**60% fewer bugs** - Isolated changes

## Start Today

Refactor one tightly coupled module. You'll see the value immediately.

**From 6 weeks to 2 weeks. That's clean architecture.**
