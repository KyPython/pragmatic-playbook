# Reversible Decisions: Deploy on Friday 5 PM Without Fear

Our deployments took 1.5 hours. If something broke, rollback took hours. We only deployed on Monday mornings. Then we implemented reversible decisions and deployed on Friday 5 PM without fear.

## What Are Reversible Decisions?

Reversible decisions mean you can undo changes quickly. Feature flags let you:
- Deploy code without enabling it
- Rollback in 2 minutes
- A/B test features
- Deploy anytime

## The Problem

All-or-nothing deployments:
- Deployment: 1.5 hours (manual steps)
- Rollback: Hours to days
- Fear: Only deploy on Monday mornings
- Downtime: Hours when things break

## The Solution

Reversible deployments:
- Deployment: 8 minutes (automated)
- Rollback: 2 minutes (feature flags)
- Confidence: Deploy anytime
- Downtime: Zero

## Real Impact

**Before:**
- Deployment: 1.5 hours
- Rollback: Hours
- Confidence: Low
- Downtime: Hours

**After:**
- Deployment: 8 minutes
- Rollback: 2 minutes
- Confidence: High
- Downtime: Zero

## Implementation

1. **Feature flags** - Toggle features without redeploying
2. **Automated deployment** - CI/CD pipeline
3. **Rollback mechanism** - Disable feature flags instantly
4. **Monitoring** - Know immediately if something breaks

## The ROI

**10x faster deployments** - 8 minutes instead of 1.5 hours
**100x faster rollbacks** - 2 minutes instead of hours
**Deploy anytime** - Friday 5 PM without fear

## Start Today

Add one feature flag to your next deployment. You'll see the value immediately.

**Deploy in 8 minutes. Rollback in 2. That's reversible decisions.**
