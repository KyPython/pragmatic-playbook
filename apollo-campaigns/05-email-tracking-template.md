Hi [Name],

Thanks for the reply! I'd love to learn more about [Company]'s infrastructure challenges.

Quick question: What's your biggest pain point right now?
- Deployment speed?
- Technical debt?
- Team scaling?

I can help with a free 15-minute call to discuss. Would [Day] at [Time] work?

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### For "Not Interested" Replies

Hi [Name],

No problem at all - thanks for letting me know!

If you know any other Seed/Series A CTOs who might be interested, I'd appreciate an intro.

Best of luck with [Company]!

Best,
[Your Name]

### For "Out of Office" Replies

```
Hi [Name],

Saw you're out of office. When you're back, I'd love to discuss how I can help [Company] recover lost velocity.
