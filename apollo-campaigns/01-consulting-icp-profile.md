## Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

### Company Profile

**Company Size:**
- Employees: 10-50 (seed to Series A startups)
- Engineering team: **5-15 developers** (sweet spot)
- Revenue: $500K - $10M ARR
- Funding: **Seed ($500K-$2M) or Series A ($2M-$10M)**

**Industry:**
- SaaS startups (primary)
- Fintech
- E-commerce platforms
- Developer tools
- B2B software companies

**Stage:**
- **Seed stage** (just raised $500K-$2M) - PRIMARY TARGET
- **Series A** (raised $2M-$10M, scaling team) - PRIMARY TARGET
- Pre-Series B (hitting growth milestones) - Secondary

### Decision Maker Profile

**Primary Persona: CTO / VP Engineering / Technical Founder**

**Characteristics:**
- Technical background (can code, understands the problem)
- Responsible for infrastructure decisions
- **Team has shipped for 6+ months** (velocity wall hit)
- Team is growing (hiring engineers, 5-15 current size)
- Under pressure to ship features faster
- **Recently raised funding** (has budget, needs to show progress)

**Pain Points (The "Velocity Wall"):**
- ✅ **"We ship fast but now we're slow"** - Primary pain point
- Features take 3 weeks instead of 2 days (used to be 2 days)
- Deployments are risky (only deploy Monday mornings, afraid of Friday)
- New engineers take 2+ weeks to onboard (codebase is confusing)
- Production bugs discovered days later (no monitoring/alerting)
- Team velocity is declining (Month 1: 1 feature/week → Month 6: 1 feature/3 weeks)
- Considering a rewrite (expensive, risky)
- **Manual testing before every deploy** (2+ hours per deploy)
- **No CI/CD** (deploying via SSH, risky)
- **Technical debt is invisible** until it's expensive

**Goals:**
- Ship features faster
- Deploy with confidence
- Scale team without breaking things
- Reduce production incidents
- Improve developer experience

**Secondary Persona: Technical Founder / Co-founder**

**Characteristics:**
- Built the initial product (knows the codebase)
- Now managing a team (5-15 engineers)
- Realizing infrastructure needs work (hitting limits)
- **Recently raised funding** (has budget, needs ROI)
- Budget-conscious but sees ROI (willing to invest $1,500-$3,500)

**Pain Points:**
- Technical debt slowing down growth (can't ship fast enough)
- Can't hire fast enough to keep up (velocity declining)
- Worried about scaling issues (Series A pressure)
- Need to show investors progress (features taking too long)
- **"We need to fix this before Series B"** - Urgency signal

### Company Signals (Apollo Filters)

**Technology Stack:**
- Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, Java (primary)
- AWS, GCP, Azure
- GitHub, GitLab (active repos)
- Docker, Kubernetes (or considering)

**Growth Signals (Must Have):**
- ✅ **Recently raised funding** (last 6-12 months) - Seed or Series A

### Exclusion Criteria

**Not a Good Fit:**
- ❌ Pre-seed (too early, no budget, < $500K raised)
- ❌ Series B+ (have internal resources, too large)
- ❌ Non-technical companies (don't understand the problem)
- ❌ Agencies (different business model)
- ❌ Companies with < 5 engineers (too small, not enough pain)
- ❌ Companies with > 50 engineers (too large, have internal team)
- ❌ Companies that haven't raised funding (no budget)
- ❌ Companies > 5 years old (likely already solved or too entrenched)

### Apollo Search Criteria

**Title Filters (Priority Order):**
1. CTO (highest priority - decision maker)
2. VP Engineering (high priority)
3. Head of Engineering (high priority)
4. Technical Co-founder (medium priority - may have budget constraints)
5. Engineering Lead (lower priority - may not have budget authority)

**Company Filters (Must Match):**
- Industry: Software, Internet, Computer Software, Fintech
- Company Size: **11-50 employees** (sweet spot: 15-30)
- Funding: **Seed ($500K-$2M) OR Series A ($2M-$10M)** - REQUIRED
- Location: **United States** (primary - easier timezone for calls)
- Technology: Node.js OR Python OR AWS OR GitHub (active repos)
- Company Age: **2-5 years** (hitting velocity wall)

**Engagement Signals (Nice to Have):**
- Active on LinkedIn (posts in last 30 days about technical challenges)
- Engages with technical content (likes/comments on engineering posts)
- Part of engineering communities (dev.to, Hacker News, Twitter)
- Has written about technical challenges (blog posts, LinkedIn articles)
- **Mentions "velocity" or "scaling" in posts** - Strong signal

### Messaging Angles (For Consulting Services)

**Angle 1: Velocity Recovery (PRIMARY)**
- "I help Seed/Series A startups recover $50K+ in lost velocity from technical debt"
- Focus: ROI, measurable improvements, speed
- Message: "Your team used to ship 1 feature/week. Now it takes 3 weeks. I can help you get back to 1 week."

**Angle 2: Deployment Confidence**
- "Deploy on Friday 5 PM without fear - 8-minute deployments, 2-minute rollbacks"
- Focus: Risk reduction, team confidence
- Message: "Stop being afraid to deploy. I'll set up CI/CD so you can deploy anytime."

**Angle 3: Technical Debt Audit**
- "Find $50K in hidden technical debt in 4 hours - $1,500 audit"
- Focus: Low-risk entry point, immediate value
- Message: "Let me audit your codebase. I'll show you exactly what's costing you money."

**Angle 4: Team Scaling Enablement**
- "Scale your engineering team from 5 to 15 without breaking things"
- Focus: Growth enablement, Series A → Series B preparation
- Message: "You're hiring engineers but velocity isn't improving. I'll fix the infrastructure so new hires are productive in 1 day, not 2 weeks."

### Budget Indicators

**Strong Budget Signals:**
- ✅ **Recently raised funding** (last 6-12 months) - Seed or Series A
- ✅ **Multiple open engineering roles** (3+ job postings)
- ✅ **Hiring senior engineers** (senior/lead positions = budget)
- ✅ **Mention infrastructure in job postings** ("help us scale", "improve our infrastructure")
- ✅ **Blog about "scaling challenges"** (aware of problem, willing to invest)
- ✅ **AngelList shows funding amount** ($500K+ = has budget)

**Budget Range (Consulting Services):**
- Technical Audit: **$1,500** (entry point, low risk)
- Architecture Review: **$2,500** (medium engagement)
- Testing Workshop: **$2,000** (focused solution)
- CI/CD Implementation: **$3,000** (high value)
- Refactoring Sprint: **$3,500** (hands-on work)

**Decision Authority:**
- CTO/VP Engineering: Can approve $1,500-$3,500 independently
- Technical Founder: May need co-founder approval for $3,000+
- Engineering Lead: Likely needs CTO approval (lower priority)

### Outreach Timing

**Best Times (High Intent):**
- ✅ **After funding announcement** (within 30 days) - Has budget, needs to show progress
- ✅ **When they post engineering jobs** (hiring = growing = infrastructure needs)
- ✅ **After they blog about technical challenges** (aware of problem, actively thinking about it)
- ✅ **Q4 (budget planning)** - Planning next year's initiatives
- ✅ **Q1 (new initiatives)** - Starting new projects, fresh budget
- ✅ **After Series A raise** (within 60 days) - Pressure to scale, has budget

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Right after a major product launch (distracted, celebrating)
- ❌ During active fundraising (distracted, no budget yet)
- ❌ Holiday weeks (low engagement)
- ❌ Right before major deadlines (too busy)
- ❌ Companies that just raised Series B+ (likely have internal resources)

### Success Metrics

**Qualified Lead Indicators:**
- Responds to email within 48 hours
- Asks specific technical questions
- Mentions specific pain points
- Requests a call or demo
- Engages with content (opens, clicks)

**Conversion Signals:**
- "We're experiencing this exact problem"
- "How much would this cost?"
- "Can you help us with [specific issue]?"
- "When can we schedule a call?"
