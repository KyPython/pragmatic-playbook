- "Quick" / "Fast" instead of "instant"
- "Straightforward" / "Manageable" instead of "easy"
- "Help" instead of "fix"

## Quick Review Questions

Before publishing any material, ask:

1. **Is this plausible?** (No overselling, extremes, or overstatements)
2. **Do I acknowledge other solutions?** (Not the only option)
3. **Do I admit limitations?** (What won't work, what's required)
4. **Is the language plain?** (Clear, simple, enough but not too much)
5. **Do I show respect?** (Understand their truth, seek common ground)
6. **Do I build trust?** (Tell story, engage, provide both good and bad)
7. **Is the promise realistic?** (Matches the journey, not oversold)
8. **Are steps simplified?** (Fewer decisions, clearer path)
9. **Do I reinforce dreams?** (Show outcomes, remove fears)
10. **Do I create appropriate tension?** (Urgency without pressure)
