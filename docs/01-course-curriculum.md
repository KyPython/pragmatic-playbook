# Course Curriculum: The Founder's Infrastructure Playbook

## Overview

An 8-week intensive course teaching Pragmatic Programmer principles through hands-on coding projects. Each week focuses on a specific principle with real-world applications.

## Week 1-2: Foundation Principles

### Project 1: Broken Windows
**Principle:** Technical debt detection and cost calculation

**Learning Objectives:**
- Identify technical debt in codebases
- Calculate the true cost of shortcuts
- Understand the compound interest of bad code
- Learn to prioritize debt repayment

**Time Investment:** 4-6 hours
**Difficulty:** Beginner

### Project 2: Tracer Bullets
**Principle:** MVP velocity and feature prioritization

**Learning Objectives:**
- Build end-to-end features quickly
- Prioritize features that deliver value
- Deploy incomplete but working systems
- Iterate based on real user feedback

**Time Investment:** 6-8 hours
**Difficulty:** Beginner-Intermediate

## Week 3-4: Code Quality

### Project 3: DRY Refactor
**Principle:** Don't Repeat Yourself

**Learning Objectives:**
- Identify code duplication
- Extract common logic into reusable functions
- Understand when duplication is acceptable
- Measure the cost of duplication

**Time Investment:** 4-6 hours
**Difficulty:** Intermediate

### Project 4: Design by Contract
**Principle:** Precondition checks and crash-early philosophy

**Learning Objectives:**
- Define clear contracts for functions
- Validate inputs at boundaries
- Fail fast with clear error messages
- Prevent data corruption through validation

**Time Investment:** 5-7 hours
**Difficulty:** Intermediate

## Week 5-6: Reliability

### Project 5: Error Handling
**Principle:** 3-tier error handling (dev/staging/production)

**Learning Objectives:**
- Structure errors for different environments
- Implement proper logging and alerting
- Handle errors gracefully without breaking UX
- Create error recovery strategies

**Time Investment:** 6-8 hours
**Difficulty:** Intermediate-Advanced

### Project 6: Testing Pyramid
**Principle:** Unit, integration, and E2E testing strategies

**Learning Objectives:**
- Write effective unit tests
- Design integration tests
- Implement E2E tests for critical paths
- Achieve 70%+ test coverage
- Understand test pyramid vs iceberg antipattern

**Time Investment:** 8-10 hours
**Difficulty:** Intermediate-Advanced

## Week 7-8: Production Excellence

### Project 7: Reversible Decisions
**Principle:** Feature flags and safe deployment patterns

**Learning Objectives:**
- Implement feature flags
- Create rollback strategies
- Deploy safely to production
- Monitor feature adoption
- A/B test new features

**Time Investment:** 6-8 hours
**Difficulty:** Advanced

### Project 8: Advanced Patterns
**Principle:** Clean architecture and decoupling

**Learning Objectives:**
- Design orthogonal systems
- Eliminate circular dependencies
- Create clear module boundaries
- Build systems that are easy to extend
- Understand coupling vs cohesion

**Time Investment:** 8-10 hours
**Difficulty:** Advanced

### Project 9: Deployment Strategies
**Principle:** CI/CD, monitoring, and runbooks

**Learning Objectives:**
- Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD
- Implement monitoring with Sentry
- Create deployment runbooks
- Automate testing and deployment
- Deploy with confidence

**Time Investment:** 10-12 hours
**Difficulty:** Advanced

### Project 10: Architecture Audit
**Principle:** 90-day improvement plan with metrics

**Learning Objectives:**
- Audit existing codebases
- Identify improvement opportunities
- Create actionable 90-day plans
- Measure ROI of improvements
- Prioritize technical debt

**Time Investment:** 12-16 hours
**Difficulty:** Advanced

## Assessment

Each project includes:
- Starter code with bugs/antipatterns
- Solution code (reference implementation)
- Test suite to verify correctness
- README with problem statement and solution
- Learning outcomes and metrics

## Completion Criteria

To complete the course, students must:
1. Fix all bugs in starter code for Projects 1-5
2. Implement solutions for Projects 6-10
3. Pass all test suites
4. Write a reflection on each project
5. Complete the final architecture audit
