# Marketing & Sales Framework Alignment

This document ensures all marketing and sales materials follow the frameworks defined in Notion.

## Framework Overview

### 1. Cold Outreach Framework
- **Define Your Audience:** Industry, company size, role, challenges, transformation
- **Initial Outreach:** Introduce, highlight pain point, offer value
- **Qualify & Engage:** Ask about pain points/goals, confirm buying commitment, offer no-risk opportunity
- **Product Demo Workflow:** Personalize, open with impact, ask questions, demo with storytelling, show don't tell, engage, social proof, clear next steps
- **Objection Handling:** Acknowledge/redirect, empathize/clarify, challenge thoughtfully, probe concerns, use reverse logic

### 2. Copywriting Framework
- **Plausibility Principles:** Don't oversell, avoid extremes, acknowledge other solutions, admit flaws
- **Plain Language:** Assume unsophisticated audience, use clear simple language, say enough but not too much
- **Problem Resolution:** Emphasize commitment, acknowledge problems/solutions, discuss responsibilities, communicate prevention
- **3 Rules of Engagement:** Understand their truth, show respect, seek common ground
- **7 Ways to Build Trust:** Tell your story, engage actively, provide good and bad, allow comments, update regularly, use multimedia

### 3. Marketing Funnel Framework
- **Attract Right Audience:** Target Seed/Series A CTOs with velocity challenges
- **Promise Matches Journey:** Course → Consulting → Results
- **Simplify Steps:** Clear CTAs, minimal friction
- **Reinforce Dreams/Remove Fears:** Show outcomes, address concerns
- **Create Tension:** Urgency without pressure
- **Empower Sharing:** Social proof, case studies

### 4. Who-What-When Framework
- **What:** Dream outcomes (2-day feature cycles), nightmares (3-week deployments), risk (technical debt), speed (8-minute deploys), effort (minimal)
- **Who:** Social status (CTO/VP Engineering), peer influence (similar startups)
- **When:** Past (what happened), present (current state), future (consequences)

## Current Materials Review
