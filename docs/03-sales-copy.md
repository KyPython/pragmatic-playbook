# Sales Copy: The Founder's Infrastructure Playbook

## Landing Page Headline

**Stop Fighting Your Codebase. Start Shipping Features.**

The 8-week course that teaches you to build production-grade infrastructure using Pragmatic Programmer principles. 10 hands-on projects. Real buggy code. Production-ready solutions.

## Problem Statement

You're a founder who can code, but your infrastructure is holding you back:

- **Features take 3 months instead of 2 weeks**
- **Every deployment is a gamble** - will it break production?
- **Your team is afraid to touch old code** - too risky
- **Technical debt is invisible** until it's too expensive to fix
- **You're manually testing** before every deploy (and still finding bugs)

You know there's a better way, but you don't have time to read 20 books or take a 6-month bootcamp.

## Solution

**The Founder's Infrastructure Playbook** is a practical, hands-on course that teaches you to:

✅ **Detect technical debt** before it costs you $50k
✅ **Build MVPs in 2 weeks** instead of 3 months
✅ **Deploy fearlessly** on Friday at 5 PM
✅ **Refactor safely** with confidence through testing
✅ **Scale your team** without breaking existing features

## What You Get

### 10 Hands-On Projects
Each project starts with real, buggy code. You'll fix it, refactor it, and learn the principle through practice.

### Production-Ready Solutions
Every project includes a reference implementation you can use in your own codebase.

### 8 Weeks of Structured Learning
Week-by-week curriculum covering foundation → quality → reliability → production.

### Blog Posts & Email Sequences
Ongoing learning resources you can share with your team.

### Templates & Checklists
Ready-to-use audit checklists, action plans, and case study templates.

## Who This Is For

✅ **Technical founders** who want to build better infrastructure
✅ **Engineering leads** responsible for code quality
✅ **Startup CTOs** scaling their first engineering team
✅ **Solo developers** building products that need to scale

**Not for:** Complete beginners (you need basic coding experience)
