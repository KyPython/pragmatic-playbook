# Consulting Outreach Email Sequence

## Email 1: Initial Outreach

**Subject:** Quick question about your infrastructure

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] is growing fast. Congrats!

**Quick question:** How long does it take to deploy a new feature?

Most startups I work with say 1-2 weeks. But I've helped teams get it down to 2 days through:
- Automated testing (70% coverage in one week)
- CI/CD pipelines (8-minute deployments)
- Feature flags (2-minute rollbacks)

**Would you be open to a 15-minute call** to discuss your infrastructure challenges?

No pitch, just a conversation.

Best,

## Email 2: Follow-up (If No Response)

**Subject:** Re: Quick question about your infrastructure

Hi [Name],

Following up on my last email. I know you're busy.

**Quick case study:** I helped a startup reduce deployment time from 1.5 hours to 8 minutes. They now deploy on Friday 5 PM without fear.

**The cost of slow deployments:**
- Features take 2 weeks instead of 2 days
- Team afraid to deploy (only Monday mornings)
- Production bugs take hours to fix

**Would 15 minutes be worth it** to discuss how to deploy faster?

Best,
