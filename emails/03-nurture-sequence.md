## Email 1: Technical Debt Calculator

**Subject:** How much is your technical debt costing?

Hi [Name],

Quick question: How many TODO comments are in your codebase?

Run this:
```bash
grep -r "TODO" . | wc -l
```

**The math:** Every $1 of technical debt costs $3-5 in future development time.

If you have 50 TODOs, that's roughly $10k-25k in future costs.

**Want to calculate your exact cost?** I've created a free technical debt calculator: [link]

Use it to:
- Find all technical debt
- Calculate the true cost
- Prioritize fixes by ROI

Let me know what you find!

Best,

## Email 2: Deployment Speed

**Subject:** How fast can you deploy?

Hi [Name],

**Quick test:** How long does it take to deploy a new feature?

- 2 days? (Great!)
- 2 weeks? (Room for improvement)
- 2 months? (We need to talk)

**The cost of slow deployments:**
- Features take 10x longer
- Team afraid to deploy
- Production bugs take hours to fix

**I've seen teams go from 2 weeks to 2 days** through:
- Automated testing
- CI/CD pipelines
- Feature flags
