# Course Launch Email Sequence

## Email 1: Welcome (Day 0)

**Subject:** Welcome to The Founder's Infrastructure Playbook

Hi [Name],

Welcome! You've taken the first step toward building production-grade infrastructure.

Over the next 8 weeks, you'll learn:
- How to detect technical debt before it costs $50k
- How to build MVPs in 2 weeks instead of 3 months
- How to deploy on Friday 5 PM without fear

**Your first project is ready:** Navigate to `projects/01-broken-windows` and start identifying technical debt.

Questions? Just reply to this email.

Let's build something great,

## Email 2: Week 1 Check-in (Day 7)

**Subject:** How's Project 1 going?

Hi [Name],

You're one week in! How's Project 1: Broken Windows going?

**Quick tip:** Don't just fix the bugs - calculate the cost. Every $1 of debt costs $3-5 in future time. That calculation will help you prioritize.

**Common question:** "Should I fix all the bugs at once?"
**Answer:** No. Fix the highest-cost bugs first. Use the ROI calculation in the README.

**Next up:** Project 2: Tracer Bullets - Build an end-to-end MVP in 2 weeks.

Keep going!

## Email 3: Mid-Course Motivation (Day 21)

**Subject:** You're halfway there!

Hi [Name],

You've completed Projects 1-4. That's the foundation! 🎉

**What you've learned so far:**
- Technical debt detection
- MVP velocity
- DRY refactoring
- Design by contract

**Real impact:** You can now detect $50k of technical debt before it becomes expensive.

**Next:** Projects 5-6 focus on reliability (error handling and testing). These are game-changers for production confidence.

**Stuck?** Check the solution code - it's there to help you learn, not to copy.

You're doing great!

## Email 4: Production Week (Day 42)

**Subject:** You're ready for production!

Hi [Name],

Projects 7-9 are all about production excellence. This is where it all comes together.

**What you'll learn:**
- Feature flags and reversible deployments
- Clean architecture
- CI/CD and monitoring

**Real impact:** Deploy on Friday 5 PM without fear. Rollback in 2 minutes. Know immediately when something breaks.

**Pro tip:** Apply these to your own codebase. Don't just complete the projects - use them.

**Final project:** Architecture Audit - Create a 90-day improvement plan for your codebase.

Almost there!
